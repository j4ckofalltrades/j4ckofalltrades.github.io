## Git Deep Dive

A talk about git for SheCodes Plus Masterclass Day 2024.

This talk covers a short history of git, a peek into the .git directory
(and its internals), exploring workflows (focusing on the Feature Branch
Workflow), dealing with merge conflicts, comparing merge vs rebase, git
commands that you might not have heard of before (that you can add to your
toolkit), and a bunch of tips and tricks.
