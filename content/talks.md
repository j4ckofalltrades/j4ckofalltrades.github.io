## Git Deep Dive

A talk about git for SheCodes Plus Masterclass Day 2024.

This talk covers a short history of git, a peek into the .git directory (and its internals), exploring workflows 
(focusing on the Feature Branch Workflow), dealing with merge conflicts, comparing merge vs rebase,
git commands that you might not have heard of before (that you can add to your toolkit),
and a bunch of tips and tricks.

## Trusted Publishers  in PyPI

Trusted publishing is a "new" mechanism for uploading packages to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

It leverages the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard to facilitate the exchange of short-lived identity tokens
between a trusted third-party service and PyPI.  What's cool about this method is its applicability in
automated environments (like GitHub Actions), offering a streamlined process that removes the need for
manually generated API tokens for authentication for your publishing workflows.
