Like a [blogroll](/blogroll) but for podcasts.

I use [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) as my main podcast app but one interesting self-hostable option that I'm keeping an eye on is [PinePods](https://www.pinepods.online/). If you're looking for alternative podcast apps, check out [Overcast (iOS)](https://overcast.fm) or [AntennaPod (Android)](https://antennapod.org/).

The full list of [feeds](/blogroll.opml) are also available for download as [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML), an open standard widely used for importing/exporting feed subscriptions. You can import them directly to your podcast app of choice.
