Holding down the `Shift` key while using the scroll wheel (on a mouse) will scroll the window horizontally e.g. from left to right.

I recently discovered this when I had to charge my daily driver -- a Logitech MX Master 3S which has a dedicated horizontal scroll wheel. I was looking into mapping a horizontal scroll action when the scroll wheel is moved up or down and when a modifier key is held like `Ctrl` but was pleasantly surprised that this already existed.

If you have natural scrolling turned off then scrolling down while holding down the `Shift` key scrolls the window to the right and vice versa.

The great thing about this is that it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
