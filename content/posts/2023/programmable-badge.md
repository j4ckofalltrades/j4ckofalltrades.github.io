_Update (2024-03-08): Remove embedded gist and linked to GitHub instead._

The [Badger2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040) is a programmable E Paper/eInk/EPD badge, powered by the [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040).

Some of its features:

- _2.9" black and white E Ink® display (296 x 128 pixels)_
- _Powered by RP2040 (Dual Arm Cortex M0+ running at up to 133Mhz with 264kB of SRAM)_
- _2MB of QSPI flash supporting XiP_
- _Five front user buttons_
- _Reset and boot buttons (the boot button can also be used as a user button)_
- _USB-C connector for power and programming_
- _JST-PH connector for attaching a battery (input range 2.7V - 6V)_

I got one to play around with and to use as a digital lanyard / badge when attending meetups.

## Programming

The Badger2040 ships with a custom [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) build and a graphics library [PicoGraphics](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/modules/picographics/README.md) that
contains useful utilities for drawing on the screen. There are also a couple of examples loaded on the device by default.

In order to write code or update / run the existing  code samples, you'll need to connect it to your computer and open up an IDE with MicroPython support i.e. [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

One thing to note is you opt to use a different IDE is to make sure to name the file as `main.py` as it will
be automatically run once uploaded to the device (this is the default behavior of the RP2040), otherwise
your code will not be executed.

I ended up using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with the [MicroPython](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9777-micropython) plugin, one extra step I needed to do was to point
the plugin to the device which was located at `/dev/ttyACM0` (if you're on a Unix environment).

## Drawing

With the following built-in functions, we can draw text and shapes on the screen.  

### Constants

The screen dimensions are provided as constants.

```python
import badger2040

WIDTH = badger2040.WIDTH    # 296
HEIGHT = badger2040.HEIGHT  # 128
```

### Pen

There are 16 pen colours - or "shades of grey" - to choose, from 0 (black) to 15 (white).

```python
import badger2040

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

display.set_pen(
  colour  # int: color from 0 to 15
)
```

The thickness of the lines drawn on the screen can be also be configured.

```python
import badger2040

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

display.set_thickness(
  value  # int: thickness in pixels
)
```

### Text

The font can be changed with the `set_font` method and write using the `text` function.

```python
import badger2040

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

# Available fonts
#
# Bitmap
# - bitmap6
# - bitmap8
# - bitmap14_outline
#
# Vector
# - sans
# - gothic
# - cursive
# - serif_italic
# - serif
display.set_font(font)

display.text(
  text,       # the text string to draw 
  x,          # the destination X coordinate
  y,          # the destination Y coordinate
  wordwrap,   # number of pixels width before trying to break text into multiple lines
  scale,      # size
  angle,      # rotation angle (Vector only!)
  spacing     # letter spacing
)
```

### Shapes

There are quite a few functions available here, I just included the ones I used. You can check out the full list in the [Pico Graphics function reference](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython/modules/picographics).

__Line__ 

```python
import badger2040

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

display.line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

__Rectangle__

```python
import badger2040

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

display.rectangle(x, y, width, height)
```

## Putting it all together

```python
# Using the Badger2040 as a digital badge / lanyard

import badger2040

WIDTH = badger2040.WIDTH    # 296
HEIGHT = badger2040.HEIGHT  # 128

BANNER_HEIGHT = 30
BANNER_TEXT_SIZE = 0.8
NAME_PADDING_LEFT = 60

# badge contents
BANNER = "Random Event"
NAME = "First Name"
HANDLE = "@handle"

display = badger2040.Badger2040()

# draw banner
display.set_pen(15)
display.set_font("serif")
display.text(BANNER, 20, (BANNER_HEIGHT // 2) + 1, WIDTH, BANNER_TEXT_SIZE)
display.rectangle(1, BANNER_HEIGHT + 1, WIDTH + 1, HEIGHT - BANNER_HEIGHT)

# draw name
display.set_pen(0)
display.set_thickness(2)
display.set_font("sans")
display.text(NAME, NAME_PADDING_LEFT, HEIGHT - 60, WIDTH, 1.7)
display.text(HANDLE, NAME_PADDING_LEFT, HEIGHT - 20, WIDTH, 0.7)

# draw border enclosing banner and name
display.set_thickness(5)
display.line(WIDTH, 0, WIDTH - 1, HEIGHT)
display.line(0, HEIGHT, WIDTH - 1, HEIGHT - 1)

display.update()
```

The code is also available on GitHub as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/j4ckofalltrades/a4ec95b3e077fd7c294d20ef8095f480).
