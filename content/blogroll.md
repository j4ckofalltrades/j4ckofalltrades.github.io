Here's a list of feeds I follow. I self-host a [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS) instance to manage my RSS subscriptions, and use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) as my main RSS reader -- both are free and open source software.

The full list of [feeds](/blogroll.opml) (and [podcasts](/podcasts.opml)) are also available for download as [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML), an open standard for sharing groups of links with text and other metadata.

You can import them directly to your feed reader and/or podcast app of choice (careful, it's a firehose).
